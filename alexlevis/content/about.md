I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics & Data
Science department at [Carnegie
Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/). Before
this, I completed a PhD in Biostatistics from [Harvard
University](https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-of-study/all/biostatistics),
and obtained a MSc in Biostatistics and BSc in Pharmacology from
[McGill
University](https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/education/grad/biostatistics). Broadly,
I am interested causal inference and missing data, and typically
appeal to statistical methods backed by semiparametric efficiency
theory.

A main purpose of this website is to be a platform for hosting short
[posts](/posts) about statistics, math, or other topics. I may add a
dedicated research page in the future, but for now feel free to check
me out on [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T-FpnSYAAAAJ&hl=en)
to see what I've worked on.
